# PredPotS

**PredPotS** is a web application designed to predict one electron reduction potential in aqueous environment using machine learning models trained on chemical data.

The live web app is available here: [PredPotS Web Application](https://predpots.ttk.hu/)  

## This GitHub Repository

This repository contains resources related to the underlying data and ML models powering PredPotS, including:

- **`data/`**: Contains the datasets  
  - `Datasets/` with CSV files of molecular data  
  - `xyz_files/` with zipped XYZ geometry files  

- **`model_training/`**: Python code used for training the machine learning models that are deployed in the backend of the web application.

For detailed explanations please refer to the  [PredPotS Web Application](https://predpots.ttk.hu/) or the related [publication](YOUR_PAPER_LINK).
