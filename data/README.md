# PredPotS

**PredPotS** is a web application designed to predict one electron reduction potential in aqueous environment using machine learning models trained on chemical data.

The live web app is available here: [PredPotS Web Application](https://predpots.ttk.hu/)  

# Data Folder

This folder contains datasets used for training and testing machine learning models in the **PredPotS** project.
